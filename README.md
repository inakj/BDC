# CBDC
CBDC -  Concrete Beam design checker is a Python tool to control capacity for a concrete beam. The tool consist of a collection of scripts made in Python using object oriented programming. The script apply for a simply supported beam with evenly distrubuted self-load and live-load, with either one layer of ordinary reinforcement, one layer of prestressed reinforcement or a combination of these. The cross section must be rectangular. The script control capacity in SLS and ULS. The calculation is done according to Eurocode 2 and the book 'Betongkonstruksjoner' by Stein Ivar SÃ¸rensen.

All scripts are listed and explained below.
